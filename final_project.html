    In today’s world, lithium batteries power everything from smartphones and laptops to electric toothbrushes and portable chargers. As our reliance on these rechargeable batteries grows, so does the concern surrounding their safety—particularly when it comes to air travel. Over the past decade, lithium battery incidents on airplanes have left increased concern from airlines and security experts alike.
    
    Why Are Lithium Batteries a Risk in the Air?
    
    Lithium-ion batteries are compact and energy-dense, making them ideal for modern electronics. However, under certain conditions—like physical damage, manufacturing defects, or exposure to heat—they can short-circuit, overheat, and catch fire. In the controlled environment of a flight cabin, where the crew must manage hundreds of passengers in a the airplane, such an event can be catastrophic.
    
    “Lithium batteries are meant to be put away before boarding flights,” says Justin Baum, head of security at Syracuse Hancock International Airport. “They can cause problems once in the air if they start to overheat.”
    
    The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has recorded hundreds of lithium battery-related incidents since 2006. These include devices catching fire in overhead bins, under seats, or inside checked baggage. In 2023 alone, more than 60 of these incidents were reported in the U.S., many involving power banks, vape pens, and e-bikes with big batteries.
    
    For example, in February 2023, a flight from San Diego to Newark had to make an emergency landing after a passenger's external battery charger caught fire mid-flight. Crew members responded quickly using a special fire containment bag, but several passengers were treated for smoke inhalation.
    
    Airlines have responded by tightening restrictions. Delta, American Airlines, and United all limit the size and type of lithium batteries allowed on board. Most follow the International Air Transport Association guidelines, which has a limit on personal lithium-ion batteries at 100 watt-hours (Wh). Most smartphones have batteries between 5 and 15 Wh, while laptops range from 30 to 90 Wh.
    
    “The general limit for Watt-hours on planes internationally is 100,” Baum explains. “If over that, the risk is higher for problems. The reason they are carry-on items is so flight attendants can respond quickly.”

<p> Carry-On vs. Checked Luggage
    
    One of the most important airline safety rules is that extra lithium batteries must be carried on board—not placed in checked luggage. The rationale is simple: if a fire starts in the cabin, flight attendants can respond immediately with fire extinguishers. In contrast, a fire in the cargo hold might go undetected until it’s too late.
    
    Airlines like Emirates have specific protocols for battery-powered devices. Some carriers even mandate fireproof cases for transporting high-capacity batteries used in professional film equipment.
    
    In 2016, the FAA banned the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 from all flights after many battery explosions. The incident served as a wake-up call to the aviation industry about how even mainstream electronics can become hazardous.
    
    Evolving Regulations and Preventive Measures
    
    To prevent accidents, the FAA and international aviation authorities have developed guidelines for the transport of lithium batteries. Passengers are advised to:
    
    Keep battery-powered devices in their carry-on bags.
    
    Turn off devices during takeoff and landing.
    
    Use only manufacturer-approved chargers.
    
    Avoid overcharging devices before a flight.
    
    Protect batteries from being crushed or punctured.
    
    Airports are also implemneting more of an education factor. Posters, announcements, and TSA checkpoint signs remind travelers about battery safety. At some airports, like Syracuse Hancock International, security staff are trained to question people carrying large battery packs or unfamiliar devices.
    
    A Shared Responsibility
    
    While airline crews are equipped to handle emergencies, the primary responsibility falls on passengers to follow the rules. Many incidents could be prevented by proper packing.
    
    “Passengers often underestimate how much energy is stored in these small devices,” says Baum. “They may seem harmless, but if something goes wrong at in the air, it can escalate very quickly.”
    
    As battery technology evolves—especially with more electric aircraft and drones, the aviation industry will continue to face more challenges.
    
     With the right protocols in place, the risks associated with lithium batteries can be smaller. </p>
