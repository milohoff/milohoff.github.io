			<p>Gun violence has been an issue that has plagued the American school system for years. As of today, there have been 323 school shootings in the United States this year alone. But for that same amount of time, there has been little action on tightening gun laws to protect children and teachers in schools. But there is a way that people at home can stop the violence occurring in our schools.

				The answer is locking your firearms up and keeping them in a safe, to keep your kids safe.

				Gun safety is one of the best ways to keep avoidable shooting incidents from happening. While gun purchases have spiked in recent years, gun safety numbers haven’t. Millions of Americans still do not take the necessary precautions to keep their firearms safely stored in the home, and for a small few of them, it is costing people’s lives.
	
				According to a study done by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, more than half of all gun owners in the United States leave their firearms unlocked and easily accessible. In 2021, that meant of the 7,512,175 gun owners across the US, around 4 million of them left their guns unlocked.</p>
